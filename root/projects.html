To visualize how party lines have evolved over time in the United States, I developed a tool to webscrape Wikipedia (Party Divisions of United States Congresses).<br>
I used the data I retrieved through webscraping to create two pairs of charts: one showing the total count of seats over time, which gave a great visual of America's growth over its 250 year history, and another showing the percent share of seats, which gave an idea of which party held power in each congress.<br>
This project reinforced my skills in:
<UL>
<LI>Data Collection &#150; I created a headless browser using Selenium in order to access Wikipedia. With BeautifulSoup, I extracted the HTML table data from Wikipedia and converted it to a Pandas DataFrame.
<LI>Data Cleaning &#150; The table data I extracted directly from Wikipedia was complex and filled with annotations. I systematically split the data by congress and party, then removed annotations to preserve the numerical data.
<LI>Data Visualization &#150; I created the final images by importing the cleaned data to Microsoft Excel, where I generated two styles of column charts.
<LI>Python Programming &#150; This project required extensive work with Pandas DataFrames. The final program had a little over two hundred lines of code.

Using OpenWeather's free API service, I wrote the framework for a weather dashboard in Python.<br>
I parsed the data from json format to collect current weather data including temperature, high and low temperatures, feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, air pressure, and a brief qualitiative description of weather conditions. I also collected a five-day weather forecast and used the data to plot temperature with feels like temperature at a 24 hour scale, temperature at a 120 hour scale, and to build a table detailing predicted weather conditions and precipitation chance. Next I collected air quality data, including concentrations for pollutants and particulates, and generated a color-coded Air Quality Report dashboard.<br>
This project reinforced my skills in:
<UL>
<LI>Data Collection &#150; I used four different APIs to gather all needed data. In order to extract the data I needed, I had to work with json files, Pandas DataFrames, and dictionaries.
<LI>Data Visualization &#150; I worked extensively with the Matplotlib Python library. The 24-hour and 120-hour temperature forecasts used line plots. The Air Quality Report used bar charts to display index and air component levels.
<LI>Python Programming &#150; Generating the reports required several complex functions, such as my "get_stacks" function, which wa snecessary to create the color-coded bands for the Air Quality Report, as well as the use of several libraries. The final program had nearly five hundred lines of code.
